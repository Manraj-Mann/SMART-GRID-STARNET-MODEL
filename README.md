# StarNet Ensemble: A Web-Based Stacking Ensemble Framework for Smart Grid Stability ⚡

> **Enhancing Predictive Reliability and Automation for Smart Grids with Machine Learning**

---

## 📝 Overview

**StarNet Ensemble** introduces a comprehensive, web-based framework featuring an integrated machine-learning-driven GUI for predicting smart grid stability. Leveraging a stacking-based ensemble learning approach, this system is designed to ensure reliable and effective electricity distribution within smart grids.

## 🧑‍🔬 Abstract

Maintaining stability in smart grids is critical for modern energy systems. This work presents the StarNet Model—a stacking ensemble integrated into a web-based platform for real-time, automated stability prediction and management. The framework utilizes a synthetic dataset derived from a 4-node star network (60,000 data points, 12 features, 2 targets), enabling robust predictive modeling and comparative evaluation. Achieving a prediction accuracy of 99.43%, the system supports real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated grid services (e.g., load shedding, demand response) via an interactive GUI, empowering stakeholders to optimize operations and minimize outages.
