## Results

The results demonstrate that ensemble and deep learning models significantly outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in predicting smart grid stability. The **StarNet stacking ensemble model** achieved the highest overall performance, with an accuracy of 99.42%, precision of 99.63%, recall of 99.47%, F1-score of 99.55%, AUC-ROC of 99.41%, and specificity of 99.35%. Other advanced models such as CatBoost, AdaBoost, and SVM also exhibited strong results, but the StarNet model consistently led across all metrics, highlighting its robustness and reliability for smart grid applications.
